**PowerAudit roadmap:**

New features roadmap:
- Checking if your computer uses a VPN
- Checking if the computer uses a network card
- Adding a progress bar during the script execution (kida cool i think)
- ...

Features improvement roadmap:
- Finding Microsoft Office version (Working by using the sofware name for now)
- Fixing the GPU detection if you're on a workstation
- Getting the script more human readable by organizing the lines differently (it's PowerShell, we really don't care about performances)

I'm open to all suggestions :)


I'm thinking about making a external module to run as admin, with more functionality.
For now, this script is fully running without any rights, but i quickly reached the limits about this.
